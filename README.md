🛠️ NetTool C 
NetTool C is an educational project written in C, created to practice concepts in computer networking and security. It includes two main features:

Packet Sniffer — captures and displays network packet information (Npcap integration coming soon)

TCP Port Manager — opens and closes ports on the local system, simulating simple TCP servers

⚠️ Project under development.
The base structure is functional, with an interactive text menu already working.
Next steps include integrating with Npcap and implementing actual TCP sockets.
